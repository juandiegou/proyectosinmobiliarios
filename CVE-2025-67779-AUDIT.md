## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2025-67779

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-67779  
**Published:** December 11, 2025  
**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Denial of Service (DoS)

**Description:**  
An incomplete fix for CVE-2025-55184 in React Server Components that allows malicious HTTP requests to cause infinite loops in the React Server Components runtime, leading to server process hang and CPU consumption.

**Affected Software:**
- React: 19.0.2, 19.1.3, 19.2.2
- Next.js: 13.x, 14.x, 15.x, 16.x (when using App Router)

**Patched Versions:**
- React: 19.0.3, 19.1.4, 19.2.3
- Next.js: 15.4.10, 15.5.9, 16.0.10
- Release Date: December 11, 2025

## Project Analysis

### Current Configuration

**Frontend Application:** `/Prueba/FRONT/propital/`

| Dependency | Current Version | Status | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|--------|-------|
| React | 18.3.1 | ✅ Not Affected | CVE only affects React 19.x |
| React-DOM | 18.3.1 | ✅ Not Affected | Matches React version |
| Next.js | 15.6.4 | ✅ Patched | Stable LTS (downgraded from 16.1.5 for stability) |
| ESLint | 9.26.0+ | ✅ Patched | Upgraded from 8.0.0 (Feb 2, 2026) |
| @types/react | 18.3.17 | ✅ Compatible | Type definitions |
| @types/react-dom | 18.3.5 | ✅ Compatible | Type definitions |

### Architecture Analysis

**Router Type:** Pages Router  
**Location:** `/Prueba/FRONT/propital/src/pages/`

**Key Finding:** The project uses Next.js Pages Router, NOT App Router. CVE-2025-67779 specifically affects Next.js applications using the App Router with React Server Components.

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ find /Prueba/FRONT/propital -type d -name "app"
# No results - App Router not used

$ find /Prueba/FRONT/propital -type d -name "pages"
/Prueba/FRONT/propital/src/pages
# Pages Router detected
```

### Vulnerability Assessment

#### Risk Factors

1. **React Version:** ✅ LOW RISK
   - Using React 18.3.1
   - CVE-2025-67779 only affects React 19.x

2. **Router Architecture:** ✅ LOW RISK
   - Using Pages Router
   - App Router (vulnerable component) not in use

3. **Next.js Version:** ✅ SECURED
   - Using Next.js 15.6.4 (stable LTS release)
   - Downgraded from 16.1.5 (7-day-old bleeding-edge release) for production stability
   - Patched for GHSA-h25m-26qc-wcjf (High severity DoS)
   - One moderate issue (GHSA-5f7q-jpqc-wp7h) not applicable (PPR not used)
   - See NEXTJS-VERSION-ANALYSIS.md for detailed risk assessment

4. **ESLint Version:** ✅ SECURED
   - Using ESLint 9.26.0+ (upgraded from 8.0.0)
   - Patched for GHSA-p5wg-g6qr-c7cg (Stack overflow vulnerability)

#### Attack Vector

For this vulnerability to be exploited, the following conditions must be met:
- [ ] Using React 19.0.2, 19.1.3, or 19.2.2 ❌ (Using 18.3.1)
- [ ] Using Next.js with App Router ❌ (Using Pages Router)
- [ ] Server Functions exposed to external requests ❌ (N/A)

**Conclusion:** This project does NOT meet any of the required conditions for exploitation.

## Verification Steps Performed

### 1. Dependency Version Check (February 2, 2026)
```bash
$ npm list react react-dom next eslint
propital@0.1.0
├── react@18.3.1
├── react-dom@18.3.1
├── next@15.6.4
└── eslint@9.26.0
```

**Note:** Version 15.6.4 was selected after comprehensive risk analysis. Previous version 16.1.5 was deemed too new for production (only 7 days old). See NEXTJS-VERSION-ANALYSIS.md for details.

### 2. Security Audit (February 2, 2026)
```bash
$ npm audit
# 1 moderate severity vulnerability
# GHSA-5f7q-jpqc-wp7h - Not applicable (PPR not used)
```

### 3. Verified Patches Applied
- ✅ Next.js at stable LTS version 15.6.4 (downgraded from unstable 16.1.5)
- ✅ ESLint upgraded from 8.0.0 → 9.26.0+
- ✅ High severity vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ Backend Python dependencies verified secure
- ✅ Node.js requirement relaxed to >=18.18.0 for better compatibility

### 4. Architecture Verification
```bash
$ ls Prueba/FRONT/propital/src/
components  hooks  pages  request  services  store  styles  templates  types  utils
```
- ✅ `/pages` directory exists (Pages Router)
- ✅ No `/app` directory (App Router not used)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
✅ **None Required** - Project is not vulnerable

### Preventive Measures

1. **Maintain Current Versions**
   - Continue using React 18.x until React 19.x is stable and patched
   - Keep Next.js at stable LTS version 15.6.x
   - Avoid bleeding-edge releases (wait 30+ days after major version releases)
   - Prefer stability over latest features for production

2. **If Upgrading to React 19.x**
   ```json
   {
     "react": "^19.2.3",
     "react-dom": "^19.2.3"
   }
   ```
   Ensure minimum versions: 19.0.3, 19.1.4, or 19.2.3+

3. **If Migrating to App Router**
   - Ensure Next.js is at stable version (15.6.x+ or wait for 16.3.0+)
   - Do not use versions < 30 days old in production
   - Implement rate limiting on Server Actions
   - Add request validation middleware
   - Monitor server CPU usage for anomalies

4. **Regular Security Audits**
   ```bash
   # Run monthly
   npm audit
   npm outdated
   ```

5. **Dependency Update Strategy**
   - Review Next.js release notes before upgrading
   - Test in staging environment first
   - Monitor for security advisories
